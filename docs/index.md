Maven project for generating a Java wrapper around [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) 
for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. 

For Windows, binaries are included in the jars and *rsync4j* 
will set up an environment in the user's home directory (`%USERPROFILE%\rsync4j`)
on first usage (can be customized, see Section [Custom location](windows/#custom-location)). 

Now supports 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
